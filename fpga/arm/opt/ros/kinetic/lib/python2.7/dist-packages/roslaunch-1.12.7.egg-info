Description: roslaunch is a tool for easily launching multiple ROS <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Nodes">nodes</a> locally and remotely
            via SSH, as well as setting parameters on the <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Parameter Server">Parameter
            Server</a>. It includes options to automatically respawn processes
            that have already died. roslaunch takes in one or more XML
            configuration files (with the <tt>.launch</tt> extension) that
            specify the parameters to set and nodes to launch, as well as the
            machines that they should be run on.
