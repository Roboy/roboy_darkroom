Description: rospy is a pure Python client library for ROS. The rospy client
            API enables Python programmers to quickly interface with ROS <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Topics">Topics</a>, <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Services">Services</a>, and <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/Parameter Server">Parameters</a>. The
            design of rospy favors implementation speed (i.e. developer
            time) over runtime performance so that algorithms can be quickly
            prototyped and tested within ROS. It is also ideal for
            non-critical-path code, such as configuration and initialization
            code. Many of the ROS tools are written in rospy to take
            advantage of the type introspection capabilities.
        
            Many of the ROS tools, such
            as <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/rostopic">rostopic</a>
            and <a href="http://ros.org/wiki/rosservice">rosservice</a>, are
            built on top of rospy.
