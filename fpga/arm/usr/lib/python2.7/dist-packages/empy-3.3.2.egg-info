Description:     EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements
            in template text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and
            produces output.  This is accomplished via expansions, which are
            special signals to the EmPy system and are set off by a special
            prefix (by default the at sign, '@').  EmPy can expand arbitrary
            Python expressions and statements in this way, as well as a
            variety of special forms.  Textual data not explicitly delimited
            in this way is sent unaffected to the output, allowing Python to
            be used in effect as a markup language.  Also supported are "hook"
            callbacks, recording and playback via diversions, and dynamic,
            chainable filters.  The system is highly configurable via command
            line options and embedded commands.
