/** @file
 * Open MPI module-related data transfer mechanism
 *
 * A system for publishing module-related data for global
 * initialization.  Known simply as the "modex", this interface
 * provides a system for sharing data, particularly data related to
 * modules and their availability on the system.
 *
 * The modex system is tightly integrated into the general run-time
 * initialization system and takes advantage of global update periods
 * to minimize the amount of network traffic.  All updates are also
 * stored in the general purpose registry, and can be read at any time
 * during the life of the process.  Care should be taken to not call
 * the blocking receive during the first stage of global
 * initialization, as data will not be available the process will
 * likely hang.
 *
 * @note For the purpose of this interface, two components are
 * "corresponding" if:
 *   - they share the same major and minor MCA version number
 *   - they have the same type name string
 *   - they share the same major and minor type version number
 *   - they have the same component name string
 *   - they share the same major and minor component version number

/**
 * Send a module-specific buffer to all other corresponding MCA
 * modules in peer processes
 * 
 * This function takes a contiguous buffer of network-ordered data
 * and makes it available to all other MCA processes during the
 * selection process.  Modules sent by one source_component can only
 * be received by a corresponding module with the same
 * component name.
 *
 * This function is indended to be used during MCA module
 * initialization \em before \em selection (the selection process is
 * defined differently for each component type).  Each module will
 * provide a buffer containing meta information and/or parameters
 * that it wants to share with its corresponding modules in peer
 * processes.  This information typically contains location /
 * contact information for establishing communication between
 * processes (in a manner that is specific to that module).  For
 * example, a TCP-based module could provide its IP address and TCP
 * port where it is waiting on listen().  The peer process receiving
 * this buffer can therefore open a socket to the indicated IP
 * address and TCP port.
 *
 * During the selection process, the MCA framework will effectively
 * perform an "allgather" operation of all modex buffers; every
 * buffer will be available to every peer process (see
 * ompi_modex_recv()).
 *
 * The buffer is copied during the send call and may be modified or
 * free()'ed immediately after the return from this function call.
 *
 * @note Buffer contents is transparent to the MCA framework -- it \em
 * must already either be in network order or be in some format that
 * peer processes will be able to read it, regardless of pointer sizes
 * or endian bias.
