 *
 * A surface without a "role" is fairly useless, a compositor does not know
 * where, when or how to present it. The role is the purpose of a
 * wl_surface. Examples of roles are a cursor for a pointer (as set by
 * wl_pointer.set_cursor), a drag icon (wl_data_device.start_drag), a
 * sub-surface (wl_subcompositor.get_subsurface), and a window as defined
 * by a shell protocol (e.g. wl_shell.get_shell_surface).
 *
 * A surface can have only one role at a time. Initially a wl_surface does
 * not have a role. Once a wl_surface is given a role, it is set
 * permanently for the whole lifetime of the wl_surface object. Giving the
 * current role again is allowed, unless explicitly forbidden by the
 * relevant interface specification.
 *
 * Surface roles are given by requests in other interfaces such as
 * wl_pointer.set_cursor. The request should explicitly mention that this
 * request gives a role to a wl_surface. Often, this request also creates a
 * new protocol object that represents the role and adds additional
 * functionality to wl_surface. When a client wants to destroy a
 * wl_surface, they must destroy this 'role object' before the wl_surface.
 *
 * Destroying the role object does not remove the role from the wl_surface,
 * but it may stop the wl_surface from "playing the role". For instance, if
 * a wl_subsurface object is destroyed, the wl_surface it was created for
 * will be unmapped and forget its position and z-order. It is allowed to
 * create a wl_subsurface for the same wl_surface again, but it is not
 * allowed to use the wl_surface as a cursor (cursor is a different role
 * than sub-surface, and role switching is not allowed).

 *
 * An additional interface to a wl_surface object, which has been made a
 * sub-surface. A sub-surface has one parent surface. A sub-surface's size
 * and position are not limited to that of the parent. Particularly, a
 * sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its parent's area.
 *
 * A sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied and
 * the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens first is
 * irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes hidden, or if
 * a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply recursively through the
 * tree of surfaces.
 *
 * The behaviour of wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface depends on
 * the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are synchronized and
 * desynchronized, see methods wl_subsurface.set_sync and
 * wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized mode caches the wl_surface state
 * to be applied when the parent's state gets applied, and desynchronized
 * mode applies the pending wl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is
 * initially in the synchronized mode.
 *
 * Sub-surfaces have also other kind of state, which is managed by
 * wl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This state
 * includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent surface
 * (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of the parent and
 * its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and .place_below). This
 * state is applied when the parent surface's wl_surface state is applied,
 * regardless of the sub-surface's mode. As the exception, set_sync and
 * set_desync are effective immediately.
 *
 * The main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,
 * since it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.
 *
 * Even if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as in
 * synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in synchronized
 * mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the tree of surfaces.
 * This means, that one can set a sub-surface into synchronized mode, and
 * then assume that all its child and grand-child sub-surfaces are
 * synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.
 *
 * If the wl_surface associated with the wl_subsurface is destroyed, the
 * wl_subsurface object becomes inert. Note, that destroying either object
 * takes effect immediately. If you need to synchronize the removal of a
 * sub-surface to the parent surface update, unmap the sub-surface first by
 * attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent, and then destroy the
 * sub-surface.
 *
 * If the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is
 * unmapped.
